This project demonstrates breast cancer classification using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on input medical features.
it applies machine learning models to achieve high accuracy in early detection of breast cancer.
Such predictive modeling can support doctors and researchers in making faster, data-driven clinical decisions.
